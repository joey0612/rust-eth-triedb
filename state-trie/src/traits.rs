/// A trait defining the interface for secure trie operations.
///
/// `SecureTrieTrait` provides a unified abstraction for interacting with Ethereum-compatible
/// state tries that use secure key hashing. This trait defines all operations needed to
/// manage accounts and storage in an Ethereum-style state trie, where all keys are
/// hashed using Keccak-256 before being stored.
///
/// This trait is designed to be compatible with Ethereum's state trie specification
/// and can be used with Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, including BSC and
/// other EVM-compatible chains.
///
/// # Key Features
///
/// - **Account Management**: Get, update, and delete Ethereum accounts from the state trie
/// - **Storage Management**: Read and write storage values for accounts with automatic
///   key hashing
/// - **Hash-based Operations**: Support for operations using pre-hashed keys, which can
///   be more efficient when keys are already hashed
/// - **State Persistence**: Commit operations to persist state changes and obtain the
///   modified node set for database updates
///
/// # Method Categories
///
/// The trait provides two sets of methods:
///
/// 1. **Address-based methods**: Operations that take raw `Address` or `&[u8]` keys,
///    which are automatically hashed internally using Keccak-256.
///
/// 2. **Hash-based methods**: Operations that take pre-hashed `B256` keys, allowing
///    for more efficient operations when keys are already hashed (e.g., when working
///    with storage roots or when keys have been pre-computed).
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `Error` - The error type returned by trie operations. Implementations should
///   define their own error types that capture operation-specific failures.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Methods in this trait take `&mut self`, indicating that implementations are not
/// inherently thread-safe. Concurrent access should be protected by appropriate
/// synchronization primitives.
