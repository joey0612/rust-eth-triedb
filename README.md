## rust-eth-triedb

High-performance Trie/DB implementations for Ethereum state (MPT), fully compatible with gethâ€™s trie behavior and node types. The project provides COW-based updates, RocksDB-backed persistence, and parallel hashing/commit/update within and across tries.

### Features

- Full compatibility with geth trie and node types
  - Node encoding/decoding and semantics (short/branch/leaf) match geth
  - RLP and hashing behavior align with Geth, interoperable with existing blocks and state roots

- Multiple backends and COW (Copy-On-Write)
  - PathDB (RocksDB): persistent, high-throughput backend with batch writes
  - MemoryDB: in-memory backend for testing and rapid experimentation
  - COW strategy between trie and backend to reduce write amplification and unnecessary copies

- Parallel hash/commit/update
  - Parallelized node hashing inside trie (rayon-based)
  - Commit phase aggregates and writes nodes in parallel
  - Updates/commits across tries/backends can be pipelined for higher throughput

### Project layout

- `common/`: shared interfaces and types (e.g., `TrieDatabase` abstraction)
- `db/memorydb/`: in-memory database
- `db/pathdb/`: RocksDB-backed PathDB
- `state-trie/`: secure state trie core (key hashing, node structures, encoding/hashing, commit)
- `triedb/` external interface for managing account and storage tries
- `smoke-test/`: smoke tests comparing with geth (optional FFI dependency)

### Getting started

1) Build

```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

2) Smoke Test (random updates and deletes, compare the root hash with geth)

```bash
# 1. Enter project directory
cd rust-eth-triedb/smoke-test

# 2. Compile BSC library
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libbsc_trie.dylib bsc_trie_wrapper.go

# 3. Install dynamic library
sudo cp libbsc_trie.dylib /usr/local/lib/

# 4. Return to reth root directory and run test
cd ../../..
cargo run -p reth-triedb-smoke-test
```

3) Test (includes MemoryDB and state-trie unit tests)

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### External API

The state trie exposes a single, unified interface for managing both the account trie and storage trie.

> TODO: Add triedb traits

### Usage examples

> TODO: Add examples for `insert/get/commit` with MemoryDB/PathDB, and sample configuration for parallel hashing.
