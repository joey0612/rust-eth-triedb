/// A trait defining the interface for trie database operations.
///
/// This trait provides a unified abstraction for interacting with trie databases,
/// allowing implementations to work with different storage backends (e.g., RocksDB,
/// in-memory caches, or other key-value stores) while maintaining a consistent API.
///
/// The trait supports both state trie nodes and storage trie roots, enabling
/// efficient storage and retrieval of Ethereum state data. It also provides
/// methods for committing diff layers, which represent incremental state changes
/// across multiple blocks.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `Error` - The error type returned by database operations. Implementations
///   should define their own error types that capture backend-specific failures.
///
/// # Auto-implementation
///
/// This trait is automatically implemented for `Box<T>`, `Arc<T>`, and `Clone`
/// where `T: TrieDatabase`, making it easy to share database instances across
/// threads and compose different database implementations.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Implementations must be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`) to allow concurrent
/// access from multiple threads. The `auto_impl` attribute ensures that
/// wrapped implementations maintain thread safety.

    /// Retrieves a trie node from the database by its path.

    /// The path is a byte sequence that uniquely identifies the location
    /// of the node within the trie structure. This method returns the encoded
    /// node data if found, or `None` if the node does not exist.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `path` - A byte slice representing the path to the trie node in the
    ///   trie structure. The path typically corresponds to the nibble path
    ///   from the root to the target node.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `Ok(Some(data))` - The node was found and `data` contains the encoded
    ///   node data (RLP-encoded or similar format).

    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `path` - A byte slice representing the path where the node should be stored.
    /// * `data` - The encoded node data to store. This is typically RLP-encoded

    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `path` - A byte slice representing the path to check.

    /// Unlike other methods in this trait, this method does not return a `Result`.

    /// * `Ok(Some(root))` - The storage root was found for the given address.
    /// * `Ok(None)` - No storage root exists for the given address (the account
    ///   may not exist or may have empty storage).

    /// writes both trie nodes and storage roots, and updates the latest
    /// persisted state metadata.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `block_number` - The block number associated with this diff layer.
    ///   This is used to track the latest persisted block.
    /// * `state_root` - The state root hash (`B256`) for this block. This
    ///   represents the root of the entire state trie after applying all
    ///   changes in the diff layer.
    /// * `difflayer` - An optional reference to the `DiffLayer` containing
    ///   all trie node and storage root changes for this block. If `None`,

    ///   should be cleared.

    /// data does not affect queries.
