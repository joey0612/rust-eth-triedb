/// A collection of diff layers for uncommitted blocks in the trie state.

/// `DiffLayers` maintains a stack of `DiffLayer` instances, where each layer
/// represents the state changes for a specific block. This structure is used
/// to track incremental modifications to the trie before they are committed
/// to persistent storage.
///
/// The layers are ordered chronologically, with the most recent block's
/// diff layer at the front of the vector (index 0). When querying for nodes
/// or storage roots, the search proceeds from the front (most recent) to the
/// back (oldest), ensuring that the latest state takes precedence over older layers.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This structure is typically used during block processing to accumulate
/// state changes across multiple blocks before committing them to disk.
/// Each block adds a new `DiffLayer` to the front of the collection, and when
/// blocks are finalized, the layers can be merged and persisted.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// The use of `Arc<DiffLayer>` allows for efficient sharing of diff layers
/// across multiple readers without cloning the entire layer data. However,
/// this structure itself is not thread-safe and should be protected by
/// appropriate synchronization primitives if used in concurrent contexts.

    /// diff layer at the end of the vector.

    /// and cloning without deep copying the underlying data structures.

    ///
    /// When searching for a trie node or storage root, the lookup starts
    /// from the front of the vector (most recent layer at index 0) and proceeds
    /// forward. This ensures that newer state changes override older ones,
    /// maintaining the correct view of the current state.

    /// ```
